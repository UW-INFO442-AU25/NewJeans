Our project aligns with United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth, which calls for inclusive and sustainable economic growth, productive employment, and decent work for all. Within this broad framework, our focus is on the employment struggles faced by international college students in the United States.
